  {
    question: "How do I place an order?",
    answer: "Use our \"Request Quote\" feature or contact us via Instagram Chat, or our Email Address."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does 3D printing cost?",
    answer: `Simple Thingiverse & Printables requests range from $20 - $100.<br /><br />
             Longer answer: It's all determined by printer use time, amount of material used, type of material used, supports, custom color requests, and if CAD services or priority printing are involved.`
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it usually take?",
    answer: "Generally, it takes 1-2 weeks for basic requests. Custom requests, materials, or orders all take more time for shipping or CAD work."
  },
  {
    question: "What is \"CAD\"?",
    answer: "CAD stands for Computer-Aided Design, and it involves creating objects on a 3D modeling program such as Fusion360, Blender, or TinkerCAD. It can also be used to edit files from Thingiverse or Printables to add custom text or remove unwanted features."
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I find files to send you for printing?",
    answer: `Click <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">here</a> to go to Thingiverse and <a href="https://www.printables.com/">here</a> to go to Printables.<br />
             These websites have many unique ideas, and you can start there or request something more custom.`
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer shipping?",
    answer: "We sometimes offer shipping, but we generally meet with our clients in Modesto, CA."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I buy your stuff from a store?",
    answer: "Yes, but our online store presence is mainly on our Etsy page. Otherwise, most people text, email, or call us for requests."
